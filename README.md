## Description

This repository contains code, data and the final presentation for the 
final project completed for the class MSCA31006: Time Series Analysis and 
Forecasting taught by Professor Shaddy Abado at the University of Chicago 
in Winter 2023. 

## Project Overview 
We compared the performance of different time series forecast models by using each model to forecast robberies in Chicago. Different metrics were checked to test for the stationarity of the dataset and trend and seasonality were removed from the data. We also used a Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR) with some other covariates to investigate their effect on robberies. 
All code is written in R.
